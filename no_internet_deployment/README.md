# Asumptions Made
- Machine1: Machine having internet on which we will download packages
- Machine2: Machine without internet on which we will transfer and install packages


# Prerequisite
- Ensure that the OS configurations on the internet-connected machine(Machine1) match those on the offline machine for deployment(Machine2)
- It is advisable to set up a new Machine1 to prevent configuration mismatches.
- After setting up both machines, add Machine1â€™s SSH public key to the authorized_keys file on Machine2
